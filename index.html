    <h2>GAME</h2>
    <p>
      A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment
      or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool.[1] Games are distinct
      from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art,
      which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements.
      However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also
      considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or
      games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic
      layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).

    <p>
      Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement
      or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by
      amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of
      non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess
      championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their
      own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the
      entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their
      audience and who is a player.
