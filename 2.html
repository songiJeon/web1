        <p>
          Assassin's Creed Odyssey is an action role-playing video game developed by
          Ubisoft Quebec and published by Ubisoft. It is the eleventh major
          installment, and 21st overall, in the Assassin's Creed series and the
          successor to 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins. Set in the years 431-422
          BCE, the plot tells a mythological history of the Peloponnesian War
          between Athens and Sparta. Players control a male or female mercenary
          (Ancient Greek: μίσθιος misthios) who fights for both sides as they
          attempt to unite their family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assassin's Creed Odyssey was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows,
          PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and (in Japan only) for Nintendo Switch on
          October 5, 2018, with a Stadia version launching alongside the service in
          2019. The game received generally favorable reviews. The game is to be
          followed by Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which takes place in medieval
          Britain during the Viking expansion across Europe and is due to be
          released in late 2020.
