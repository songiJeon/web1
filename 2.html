    <h2>Assaddin's Creed Odyssey</h2>
    <p>
      Assassin's Creed Odyssey is an action role-playing video game developed by
      Ubisoft Quebec and published by Ubisoft. It is the eleventh major
      installment, and 21st overall, in the Assassin's Creed series and the
      successor to 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins. Set in the years 431-422
      BCE, the plot tells a mythological history of the Peloponnesian War
      between Athens and Sparta. Players control a male or female mercenary
      (Ancient Greek: μίσθιος misthios) who fights for both sides as they
      attempt to unite their family.

      Assassin's Creed Odyssey was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows,
      PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and (in Japan only) for Nintendo Switch on
      October 5, 2018, with a Stadia version launching alongside the service in
      2019. The game received generally favorable reviews. The game is to be
      followed by Assassin's Creed Valhalla, which takes place in medieval
      Britain during the Viking expansion across Europe and is due to be
      released in late 2020.
