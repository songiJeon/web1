    <h2>Horizon Zero Dawn</h2>
    <p>
      Horizon Zero Dawn is an action role-playing game developed by Guerrilla
      Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The plot follows
      Aloy, a hunter in a world overrun by machines, who sets out to uncover her
      past. The player uses ranged weapons, a spear, and stealth to combat
      mechanical creatures and other enemy forces. A skill tree provides the
      player with new abilities and bonuses. The player can explore the open
      world to discover locations and take on side quests. It was released for
      the PlayStation 4 in 2017, and will be released for Microsoft Windows in
      mid-2020.

      Horizon Zero Dawn is Guerrilla Games' first intellectual property since
      Killzone in 2004 and its first role-playing game. Development began in
      2011 after the completion of Killzone 3, with director Mathijs de Jonge
      considering it the riskiest idea pitched at the time. The game engine,
      Decima, was developed for Killzone Shadow Fall and altered for Horizon
      Zero Dawn. Being set in a post-apocalyptic setting, anthropologists were
      consulted to authenticate the world's decay over a millennium. The
      soundtrack was led by composer Joris de Man, featuring contributions from
      The Flight.
