      The six-year development of Part II began in 2014, soon after the release
      of The Last of Us Remastered. Neil Druckmann returned as creative director
      and Gustavo Santaolalla returned to compose the score. It was announced in
      December 2016 and delayed twice, first for further development and then
      due to logistical problems arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The game
      was released on June 19, 2020, to critical acclaim.
