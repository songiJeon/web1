        ><strong>Naughty Dog</strong></a
      >
      and published by <u>Sony Interactive Entertainment</u>> for the
      PlayStation 4. Set five years after The Last of Us (2013), players control
      19-year-old Ellie, who comes into conflict with a mysterious cult in a
      post-apocalyptic United States. The game contains survival horror elements
      and is played from a third-person perspective. Players can use firearms,
      improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against enemies and
      cannibalistic, creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps
      fungus.<img src="coding.jpg" width="100%" />

      The six-year development of Part II began in 2014, soon after the release
      of The Last of Us Remastered. Neil Druckmann returned as creative director
      and Gustavo Santaolalla returned to compose the score. It was announced in
      December 2016 and delayed twice, first for further development and then
      due to logistical problems arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The game
      was released on June 19, 2020, to critical acclaim.
